## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves gathering, understanding, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. The goal is to ensure the software meets user and business needs before development begins.

### Why is it important?

- ✅ It defines the scope and boundaries of the project.
- ✅ It prevents misunderstandings between developers and clients.
- ✅ It minimizes costly revisions during development.
- ✅ It ensures that the delivered system meets user expectations.
- ✅ It helps in estimating resources, time, and cost accurately.

Without proper requirement analysis, software projects are more likely to fail due to unmet expectations or overlooked features.
