## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves gathering, understanding, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. The goal is to ensure the software meets user and business needs before development begins.

### Why is it important?

- ✅ It defines the scope and boundaries of the project.
- ✅ It prevents misunderstandings between developers and clients.
- ✅ It minimizes costly revisions during development.
- ✅ It ensures that the delivered system meets user expectations.
- ✅ It helps in estimating resources, time, and cost accurately.

Without proper requirement analysis, software projects are more likely to fail due to unmet expectations or overlooked features.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a critical role in the success of any software project. It serves as the foundation for design, development, and deployment. Below are three key reasons why it is important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
### 1. Clarity of Project Scope
Requirement analysis helps clearly define what needs to be built. It prevents scope creep and ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals, features, and limitations.
### 2. Reduces Development Errors
By identifying the functional and non-functional requirements early, development teams can avoid costly mistakes and misunderstandings that often occur later in the project lifecycle.
### 3. Saves Time and Cost
Well-documented requirements allow for better planning, accurate estimation of resources, and early identification of risks — leading to faster development cycles and reduced project costs.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis consists of several essential activities that ensure the software product aligns with stakeholder expectations and technical feasibility. Below are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints. This includes interviews, questionnaires, observations, and document reviews.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging stakeholders to clarify, explore, and discover requirements through workshops, brainstorming sessions, use case discussions, and prototyping.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Structuring and recording the gathered requirements in a clear and organized format, such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or requirement traceability matrices.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. This may include creating diagrams (e.g., data flow diagrams, use case models) to visualize system behavior and relationships.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are agreed upon. Techniques include walkthroughs, reviews, and validation meetings with stakeholders.
