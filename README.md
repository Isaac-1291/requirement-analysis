# Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, evaluating, and documenting the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders for a software system. This process ensures that developers understand exactly what is required before design and development begin.
Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
It sets a clear foundation for the entire project.
It helps avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication between teams.
It ensures that the final software meets the actual needs of users.
It identifies risks, constraints, and potential issues early in the process.
It supports better planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.
A thorough requirement analysis increases the chances of delivering a successful, user-focused, and cost-effective software product.
